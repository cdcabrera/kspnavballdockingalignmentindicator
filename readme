===== How to install ==============

Copy NavBallDockingAlignmentIndicator.dll somewhere to the GameData folder in your KSP folder.

===== How to use ==================

Select a docking port as target.
An additional red marker will appear, indicating the direction your docking port needs to face to be parallel to the target docking port.

This mod is basically a light-weight version of NavyFish's Docking Port Alignment Indicator mod, using only a single marker on the NavBall instead of a whole new window.

===== How to configure ============

After the first start, there will be a textfile KSP_DIR/GameData/NavBallDockingAlignmentIndicator/PluginData/NavBallDockingAlignmentIndicator/config.xml, which you can
edit to adjust the marker color and texture (the color is a vector3 of rgb, the texture is a vector2 of x, y subtexture position on this texture: https://github.com/kitoban/EnhancedNavBall/blob/master/materialRef.JPG).

The default values are (1, 0, 0) (red) and (0, 2) (the prograde marker).

===== How to manually build =======

Use the included Makefile (or an development environment, if you wish so)
