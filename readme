===== How to install ==============

Copy NavBallDockingAlignmentIndicator.dll somewhere to the GameData folder in your KSP folder.

===== How to use ==================

Select a docking port as target.
An additional red marker will appear, indicating the direction your docking port needs to face to be parallel to the target docking port.

This mod is basically a light-weight version of NavyFish's Docking Port Alignment Indicator mod, using only a single marker on the NavBall instead of a whole new window.

===== How to manually build =======

Use the included Makefile (or an development environment, if you wish so)

===== Changelog ===================

An other huge Thank you goes to kitoban, creator of the Enhanced Navball mod, from which, being a bloody beginner at KSP modding, Unity and C#, I took a whole lot of code.
